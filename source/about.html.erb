  <p>If the water temperature is too high on the day of the event, a different game fish will be used to stock the lake in place of the trout.</p>

  <p>There will be a limit of five fish per person. There will be prizes for the biggest fish as well as other categories, random prize giveaways, a 50/50 raffle and much, much more!</p>

  <p>If you are over 16 years of age, you will need a license and inland trout stamp to fish. No license is required if under 16.</p>

  <p>Please bring your own poles and tackle! There will be a limited number of loaners available.</p>

  <p>Bait will be supplied by Triangle Bait.</p>

  <p>Fish cleaning is available for $2 per fish to bag and ice.</p>

  <p>Food will be available from the Rusty Nail. $5 includes either a hot dog or hamburger, chips and a pop.</p>
